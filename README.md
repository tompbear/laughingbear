Web site for small publisher. It will be built in HTML5, CSS, AJAX, and Javascript. As it develops, I may use PHP or Python if appropriate.
The site will have a database of magazaine and newletter articles, a storefront with printed books, magazines and ebooks. There will be a blog, photo gallery, a chat feature, and a mailing list for an electronic newletter.
Laughing Bear Press is a small press publisher established in 1976. It has had a website since 1995. It has not been updated in years and I am getting back to it. The original website was built in HTML, CSS and ASP.
The new website has the same domain as the old, laughingbear.com. My email for that is tom@laughingbear.com.
